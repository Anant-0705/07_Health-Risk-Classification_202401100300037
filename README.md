**Health Risk Classificationüßë‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è**

 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting an individual's health risk category (Low, Medium, or High) based on lifestyle factors such as BMI, exercise habits, and eating habits. By applying a Random Forest Classifier, we aim to classify health risks accurately and help stakeholders make informed health decisions.

The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation using various metrics, and visualization through confusion matrix heatmaps.

**Problem Statement**


The goal is to build a machine learning model that:

Classifies individuals into health risk categories.

Predicts health risk levels based on lifestyle attributes.

Visualizes performance metrics for better model evaluation.

 **Methodology**

 
**Data Collection:**

Loaded health data from a CSV file.

**Data Preprocessing:**

Renamed columns to match expected formats.

Encoded categorical features (Exercise, Eating Habits, Risk Category) using Label Encoding.

**Model Training:**

Used a Random Forest Classifier.

**Model Evaluation:**

Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Plotted a confusion matrix heatmap for visualization.

Prediction Function:

Created a function to predict health risk based on user inputs.
